# ✅ Compilation Error Fixed!

## Issue Resolved

**Error**: `Parsing ecmascript source code failed - Expected ',', got '< (jsx tag start)'`

## Root Cause

The HeroSection.tsx file had corrupted syntax structure, likely due to:

- Malformed JSX closing tags
- Hidden characters from previous edits
- Improper indentation causing parser confusion
